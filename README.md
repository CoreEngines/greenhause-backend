# GreenHause Backend API

Welcome to the Green House API documentation. This API provides a set of endpoints for managing green houses, including
creating, retrieving, and updating green house data. The API is designed to be RESTful, with clear and concise endpoint
names and request/response bodies.

In addition to RESTful endpoints, the API also provides real-time updates and bi-directional communication using
WebSockets.
